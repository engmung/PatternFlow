# Patternflow - Where Noise Becomes Form

# Patternflow - Where Noise Becomes Form

**Frequently Asked Questions**:

Q: What is Patternflow?
A: Patternflow is an interactive generative art platform where users discover patterns at the threshold between mathematical noise and legible form, then export them for 3D printing.

Q: Can I buy physical artwork from Patternflow?
A: Yes. Users can export their discovered patterns and order high-quality 3D printed relief sculptures.

Q: Who created Patternflow?
A: Seung Hun, a Seoul-based media artist working at the intersection of code, 3D graphics, and fabrication.

Q: What technology does Patternflow use?
A: WebGL, Three.js, custom GLSL shaders for real-time pattern generation and manipulation.

**Use Cases**:
- Interior designers seeking unique wall art for client projects
- Art collectors looking for customizable generative pieces
- Creative coders exploring interactive parametric design
- Homeowners wanting personalized 3D printed decor

**Semantic Glossary (Knowledge Graph Context)**:
- **Perlin Noise**: A gradient noise type used to create natural-looking random patterns, forming the basis of Patternflow's terrain generation.
- **Wave Function Collapse**: The algorithmic process of determining a defined state from a superposition of possibilities, metaphorically represented in the "freezing" of noise into form.
- **Visibility Threshold**: The adjustable parameter in Patternflow that determines at what density "noise" becomes a legible "form" or "object".
- **Phygital Art**: The convergence of physical and digital art. Patternflow allows users to take digital algorithms and manifest them as physical 3D printed reliefs.
- **Parametric Design**: A design process based on algorithmic thinking that enables the expression of parameters and rules that, together, define, encode and clarify the relationship between design intent and design response.

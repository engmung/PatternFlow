# Patternflow - Where Noise Becomes Form

**Summary**:
Patternflow is a generative art project and interactive web experience created by Seung Hun. It explores the threshold between mathematical noise and legible form. Users can manipulate parameters of wave functions to discover patterns and export them.

**Artist**:
Seung Hun is a Seoul-based artist working at the intersection of code, 3D graphics, and fabrication. He explores how algorithmic complexity can be tamed into human-perceivable beauty.

**Key Technical Context**:
- **Generative Engine**: Custom WebGL/Three.js implementation.
- **Interactivity**: Real-time manipulation of grid density, noise scale, and threshold.
- **Output**: Digital forms that can be exported for physical fabrication (3D printing).

**Core Documentation & Links**:
- [Home](https://patternflow.work/): The main interactive experience.
- [About & Philosophy](https://patternflow.work/about): Detail on the "Conditions of Visibility" and artist bio.
- [Studio](https://patternflow.work/studio): The tool for creating and exporting patterns.

**Semantic Glossary (Knowledge Graph Context)**:
- **Perlin Noise**: A gradient noise type used to create natural-looking random patterns, forming the basis of Patternflow's terrain generation.
- **Wave Function Collapse**: The algorithmic process of determining a defined state from a superposition of possibilities, metaphorically represented in the "freezing" of noise into form.
- **Visibility Threshold**: The adjustable parameter in Patternflow that determines at what density "noise" becomes a legible "form" or "object".
- **Phygital Art**: The convergence of physical and digital art. Patternflow allows users to take digital algorithms and manifest them as physical 3D printed reliefs.
- **Parametric Design**: A design process based on algorithmic thinking that enables the expression of parameters and rules that, together, define, encode and clarify the relationship between design intent and design response.
